Hello there friends,

In order to make something that moves using the navMesh like an enemy or npc (idk if player can be included in that),
you need to add the "Nav Mesh Agent" component to the moving entity.

Making it move from point to point is relatively easy. In a script, you need to define the nav agent, and then you can set
the .destination field of the nav agent to the .transform field of whatever entity you want it to go to.
In my basic enemy prefab, you'll see an embedded gameobject named pathing with 3 sprites inside. These sprites do not need
to have any special components and you can make the sprites invisible, the only point to them is to tell the enemy where to go.

So when you want a nav agent named Enemy move to point1 (assuming you also got that gameobject), you do 
"Enemy.destination = point1.transform"

I can include further information here if this information does not suffice.
Here are some resources I used for figuring out Nav Mesh and Agents:
