Some things to keep in mind to try and keep the project as clean as possible.

When writing code, please try to make code as:
1. Modular as possible. Code should be able to do one thing well with as little dependency as possible. A lot of code should be able to be reused in multiple different areas
  without issue. If you need to make a change to a piece of code to make it work somewhere else, unless you can make a change that is unobtrusive and 100% will not change the
  purpose of the piece of code, it would probably be better to create a child that inherits from that piece of code or to just make something new altogether.
2. Clean as possible. Obviously short is better than not short.

Also, please keep the assets directory as organized as possible; put things in the proper folders, create new folders if a place to put it doesn't already exist, etc.

Lastly and least importantly, variables start with a lower case, classes start with an upper case, and I don't know what functions start with anymore.
Frik you Unity.
