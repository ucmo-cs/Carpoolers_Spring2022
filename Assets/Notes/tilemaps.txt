https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryISV_nH8qw - very good video that explains the tilemap basics (i.e. what I know about tilemaps)
https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/using-rule-tiles - tutorial on how rule tiles work, i.e. the thing that lets you paint tiles and it figures out which ones go where automatically
Also, there's a package you need to import to use rule tiles. Since I imported it, it should be on yours, but in case it isn't:
1. Open Edit > Project Settings > Package Manager
2. In Advanced Settings, check the box for "Enable Preview Packages"
3. Open Windows > Package Manager
4. In the top left corner of the dialog, change "Packages: [Whatever it's on]" to Unity Registry
5. Find and click on "2D Tilemap Extras" in the list of packages
6. Click on install in the bottom left corner of the dialog

Also I like to move the grid .5 units to the left and down. In unity, when you normally place a gameobject, its position represents the center of the gameobject, while
when placing a tile in the tilemap, its position represents the bottom left corner of the tilemap, which means the normal unity gameobjects don't line up with the tilemap.
Moving the grid (which moves all the tilemaps under it) left and down lines the tilemaps up with the normal unity gameobjects.
