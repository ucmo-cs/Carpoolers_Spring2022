Oh boy,

I'll explain the method of using tilemaps to define where is walkable and where is not.
I'll also assume you know how to use a tilemap

You'll want to create a tilemap for places an entity can and can't go, so you need to 
1. create separate tilemapes for the ground, walls, maybe a BIG ROCK, or even a pond. 
2. you should add a NavMeshModifier component to it
3. click the option that says "Override Area"
4. choose whether the area is walkable or not for the new dropdown that showed up.
NOTE: You shouldn't need to do this on the base layer since layers are supposed to default to walkable (you can change the default),
but if the base layer isn't detected after you set up NavMeshSurface2d, then go ahead and follow the above steps to make it known.
NOTE: if you're using a layer that's just decorative, you can use NavMeshModifier and select the "Ignore From Build" option

To create a nav mesh mapping of a level, (assuming you did the steps above) you need to 
1. create an empty gameobject named "NavMesh" 
2. add a component to it called "NavMeshSurface2d"
3. click the button at the very bottom "Rotate Surface to XY".
4. click the button above it called "Bake"
You should be able to see a fancy blue thing covering all the walkable area.
NOTE: If it looks funky like there are spots that are going outside of the tilemap and into empty space, click the options
"Override by Grid" and "Compress by Bounds" in the NavMeshSurface2d component.
NOTE: If the navmesh wasn't going out of bounds without the above options selected, but not walkable areas are not looking concise
you can deselect "Override by Grid" and "Compress by Bounds" in the NavMeshSurface2d component.
