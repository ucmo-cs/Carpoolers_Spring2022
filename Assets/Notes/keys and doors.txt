There are two types of keys and doors: normal ones and specified ones. Specified ones are attached; a specific key (or keys) goes to a specific door (or doors).

Each key and door has a boolean scriptable object attached to it to determine whether it should exist. When a key is picked up or a door unlocked, the
boolean changes from true to false, meaning the object will dissapear and will even be gone if the scene is reloaded (such as if the player leaves and
returns to the dungeon).

Normal keys work with a float scriptable object called keys that lists how many keys the player has. When the player picks up a key, one is added to the keys
variable. When the player walks into a door, it checks the keys variable to see if the player has any keys. If they do, it removes one from the key variable and
unlocks the door.

Specificied keys work with a string list scriptable object called specificKeys that lists the specific keys the player currently has. When the player picks up a key,
it adds its specific key (as in a string that identifies what type of key it is) to the string list. When the player walks into a door, it checks the specificKeys variable
for the specific key (as in the string again) that is used for that door. If it finds it, it removes it from the list and unlocks.
